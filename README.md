Murg
====

A terminal text-based game written in Ruby.

I was bored with my Terminal's (mostly) B/W output and found the Colored gem for Ruby.
I was also very interested in learning Ruby.

To run
  1) Download/branch/whatever
  2) Go to the file/directory within which murg.rb is contained
  3) In Terminal, enter 'ruby murg.rb' to play
  4) Enjoy!

If you want to know more about the game, enter the "h" command when prompted.
If you want to know more about me, go to 'cs dot wisc dot edu slash tilde leo'.

Murg cuz it's Grum backwards.
